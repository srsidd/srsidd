### Hi there 👋

I'm a full stack robotics software engineer (Yep, I coined that).

Currently I work at Cohesive Robotics.
Launguages I speak fluently include English, Kannada, Python and C\C++.
I also dabble in Telugu, Hindi, SQL, Javascript, HTML and the likes.

Outside of robotics, I enjoy running, ramen and reading.
